# The Battle at the Top
This tournament gave us an incredible story at the Ozeki rank, with both Hoshoryu and Kotozakura entering the final day at 13-1, setting up a potential path to Yokozuna promotion for both wrestlers in the next tournament.

### Onosato (The Rising Star)

Fresh off his first tournament win, he's now an Ozeki and ready for his push to Yokozuna! He went 9-6. womp womp. 9-6 is like the bare minimum respectable record for an Ozeki. It's not even an Ozeki-sustaining performance. You need 33 wins across 3 tournaments.

He wasn't bad, in fact he's still a huge scary monster and his tachi-ai (the start) is like an elephant coming for you. But Sumo isn't just about bodies, it's about brains, and he got sloppy and out-thought in too many matches. In fact, none of his losses were even upsets, so the 9-6 might be bad, but it's not the whole story.

### Hoshoryu and Kotozakura (The Yokozuna Contenders)

These 2 gave us the true great story of the basho. Both established Ozeki, both probably watching all the attention Onosato has been getting, and hearing the media talking about "when" he becomes Yokozuna, and both probably thinking "Hang on, we're right here and he hasn't proven he's better than us yet."

They both were 13-1 going into the last day and were facing each other. Absolute spectacle. Hoshoryu's tournament was marked by incredible throwing technique, winning 4 out of 5 days in a row with throws. Kotozakura's tournament showed his versatility - sometimes winning like a floating boulder, sometimes with sneaky edge work.

Fun fact about Kotozakura: His weirdly shaped body has been mentioned by multiple wrestlers as a reason he's so hard to fight against. He's a doughy lumpy man and it works for him.

### Terunofuji (The Broken Yokozuna)

The current Yokozuna is so broken he has only completed 3 tournaments in the last 2 years. And he won all 3. So basically, his body is falling apart, like bad, but when he shows up, he wins because he's a monster. He didn't show up this tournament. I'm wondering if you'll ever see him show up.

Here he is a few days ago (December 2024) against the 3 Ozeki during practice:
