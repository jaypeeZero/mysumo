# The Battle at the Top
This tournament gave us an incredible story at the Ozeki rank.
Going into the tournament, the media was basically only talking about Onosato and his meteoric rise to Ozeki.

In case you don't remember, to get to Ozeki one must win 33 matches across 3 tournaments (33/45), *and maintain that record to retain the rank*.
Well it looks like both Hoshoryu and Kotozakura took that PERSONALLY.


### Onosato (The Rising Star)

Fresh off his first tournament win, he's now an Ozeki and ready for his push to Yokozuna! 

He went 9-6. womp womp. 
9-6 is like the bare minimum respectable record for an Ozeki. It's not even an Ozeki-sustaining performance. You need 33 wins across 3 tournaments.

He wasn't bad, in fact he's still a huge scary monster and his tachi-ai (the start) is like an elephant coming for you.  
But Sumo isn't just about bodies, it's about brains, and he got sloppy and out-thought in too many matches.  
In fact, none of his losses were even upsets, so the 9-6 might be bad, but it's not the whole story.

### Hoshoryu and Kotozakura (The Yokozuna Contenders)

They both were 13-1 going into the last day and were facing each other.  
Absolute spectacle.  

Hoshoryu's tournament was marked by incredible throwing technique, winning 4 out of 5 days in a row with throws.

Kotozakura's tournament showed his versatility - sometimes winning like a floating boulder, sometimes with sneaky edge work.

Fun fact about Kotozakura:  
His weirdly shaped body has been mentioned by multiple wrestlers as a reason he's so hard to fight against.   
He's a doughy lumpy man and it works for him.  
Probably because under that lumpy dough is an incredibly strong athlete.  
He's frequently described as the "hardest rikishi to move in Sumo".

### Terunofuji (The Broken Yokozuna)

The current Yokozuna is so broken he has only completed 3 tournaments in the last 2 years.  

And he won all 3.  

So basically, his body is falling apart, like bad, but when he shows up, he wins because he's a monster.  
He didn't show up this tournament. I'm wondering if you'll ever see him show up.

Here he is a few days ago (December 2024) against the 3 Ozeki during practice:
