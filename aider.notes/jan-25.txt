Ichiyamamoto deserves some recognition:

### Abi

Day 2: W - Kotozakura, shock and awe
Day 4: W - Onosato, shifty shify Abi does a pull at the edge.

Day 6: L - Takanosho, good recovery by Takanosho after good recovery by Abi.
Day 8: W - Tobizaru, just a great bout in general

### Atamifuji
Day 5: W - Hoshoryu - Super exciting fight.
Day 6: W - Kotozakura, beat him twice actually, but Kotozakura almost didn't participate.
Day 7: L - Onosato, he did well and was winning, but Onosato turned the bout with smart weight shifts

### Chiyoshoma
The wiley and smart veteran is back in the top division and showing some great “thinking man's Sumo”.

Day 2: W - Ura, great defense
Day 3: W - Ichiyamamoto, “leaping henka” and no crowd cheering at all
Day 4: W - Endo, this man is showing some fantastic wins
Day 5: W - Takayasu, seriously this man has taken his wily ways and turned it into actual wisdom-driven Sumo
Day 6: W - Mitakeumi, beautiful throw and control.
Day 7: Freebie - Roga withdrew
Day 8: L - Takarafuji, he should have had it, but overreached and got dodged.

Day 15: W - Shonanoumi - Chiyoshoma got mad and threw a “punch” at the end.

### Daieisho
My guy!

Day 1: W - Gonoyama
Day 2: W - Atamijufi, blowout
Day 3: W - Shodai, POWER
Day 5: W - Wakatakakage, good balance and shuffling, good shoving as always
Day 6: L - Kirishima, got overbalanced and just missed his last swipe after getting popped in the face.
Day 7: W - Wakamotoharu, smack em and leave em basically.
Day 8: W - Takanosho - even though hitting Takanosho is like hitting a wall, he hit that wall until it left the ring

Day 13: W - Chiyoshoma - my man showed control
Day 14: W - Hiradoumi - I love this patient and powerful man.
Day 15: W - Abi - beautiful use of the space and controlling his opponent's weight

### Hakuoho
One of the super promising youngsters, he's finally back in the top division after getting injured and falling way down the rankings to unsalaried ranks.

Day 1: W (?)
Day 3: W - Kotoshoho, good fight, lots of smashes
Day 4: L - Shonanoumi, poor loss against a poor wrestler who randomly found some fight.
Day 7: W - Tamashoho, great henka-dodge

Day 11: W - Tobizaru - First meeting, incredible fight from both men.

### Hiradoumi
Horrible tournament last time out for him.  He rose to the top ranks by being an overwhelming force, then last tournament he was a limp fish.


Day 2: W (Shodai, shock and awe)
Day 3: L - Takayasu, can see the value of added weight
Day 5: L - Ichiyamamoto - Hiradoumi might just fight Death to the last second.  Physically.
Day 6: W - Ura, aggression and persistence, wouldn't let Ura even play.
Day 7: W - Endo, Endo lost this by trying to go for a low belt grab at the tachiai, and missing, which meant Hiradoumi was lower and had a grip.

### Hoshryu
Fighting for a promotion to Yokozuna.  He basically needs to win the whole thing to get there.

Day 1: W - Kirishima (great technique)
Day 2: W - Tobizaru, controlled and powerful
Day 3: W - Wakatakakage, blew him out.
Day 4: W - Takanosho, nearly loses multiple times but an incredibly resilient fighter, wins in very controlled style at the edge.
Day 5: L - Atamifuji, an upset, but Atamifuji had to work hard for it
Day 6: W - Gonoyama, a HELL of a hit but Hoshoryu equals the blast and controls.
Day 7: L - Shodai - He just had such a hard time moving the mountain of Shodai

Day 13: W - Onosato - he is easily the most versatile wrestler out there.
Day 14: W - Takerufuji - big difference in brain work
Day 15: W - Kotozakura - he is forcing this Yokozuna race

### Kotozakura
up to Day 6: “womp womp”

the Mercurial Man

He just does not have the fire he needs.

Day 7: W - Gonoyama, after changing his mawashi to black, we see mostly the same man...but he won this time.
Day 8: W - Oho - Good fight!

### Oho
Another of the promising youngsters, fighting from M3.

Day 1: W - Abi
Day 2: W - Wakatakakage, smart moves
Day 3: W - Wakamotoharu, hard hit and followup power
Day 4: W - Daieisho, sneaky last second win, but skillfully done
Day 5: W - Onosato, another sneaky escape at the edge
Day 6: W - Tobizaru, control and power and patience.
Day 7: L - Hoshoryu, he just got controlled massively, but he kept fighting hard and even had a smart choice after for a 1% chance at win.
Day 8: L - Kotozakura, good fight

Day 13: W - Ura, Oho looked like a man who knew he had trouble beating Ura in the past.
Day 14: W - Takanosho - Oho looking like a learning young man

### Onokatsu
One of the promising youngsters.  

Day 3: ?? - ??, good fight?
Day 4: W - Midorifuji, good fight, power and pushing and keeping distance.
Day 6: W - Hakuoho, incredible defense by Hakuoho, but the pressure meant he couldn't attack back.

### Onosato
Can he perform more like an Ozeki should?

Day 1: L - Tobizaru
Day 2: W - Kirishima, not overrushing
Day 3: W - Takanosho, weak ass win, just barely as his opponent accidentally stepped out
Day 4: L - Abi, overreaching as usual
Day 5: L - Oho, overzealous at the edge.
Day 6: W - Shodai, he won on purpose and did well.
Day 7: W - Atamifuji, HE WON A MATCH HE WAS BEHIND IN, WITHOUT GETTING LUCKY OR WEAK-ASS!!!!
Day 8: W - Wakatakakage - Actual good control and reactions.

Day 11: L - Kinbozan - Nothing undeserved, Kinbozan just controlled and won.

### Takerufuji
Another super promising youngster.  He had a good showing last basho (10-5 I think?) and now his job is just rise through the ranks and don't get injured.
One of the best parts about him is his athleticism.  Not only is he insanely strong, his footwork and agility make him look more like an elete athlete than most Sumo wrestlers.

Day 2: W (with hit and shift, weak)
Day 3: W - Onokatsu, rematched, good fight and tried a different tactic in the 2nd
Day 5: W - ??? - An example of why his extra power in his upper body helps him win.
Day 6: W - Chiranoumi, good hit and pressure
Day 7: W - SHOVE!  with anger and power
Day 8: W - Kitonawaka, this man has incredible upper body strength.

Day 13: W - Abi, interesting leg sweep attempt by Abi

### Tamashoho
The guy who took 13 years to reach the top division, is finally here.
His build is almost exactly me.  Under 300lbs, 6'2", he's small for Sumo.
But he's found new expertise and knowledge at this point in his career.
Which is PROBABLY because he's at a stable with his brother-in-law, Tamawashi.  
Tamawashi is 40 years old and fighting in the top division.
Their stable only has FOUR wrestlers.  These 2, and then 2 other guys way lower down in the ranks (not even salaried).

Apparently he “eats 5 meals a day” and can't gain any more weight.

It's such a weird situation that's fun to watch.

1: W
Day 6: W - ???
Day 8: W - Midorifuji, MUST WATCH!

### Tamawashi
The man is 40 years old and still in the top division.  He's incredible.
Recently I learned that his stable is only FOUR wrestlers.  Until this tournament, he was the only one who had ever made the top division.
This tournament he finally has his brother-in-law (Tamashoho) in the top with him, but it is incredible that this man has remained in the top this long while having no real training partners.

Day 2: W (overwhelming, nice)
Day 3: W - Midorifuji, showing smart sumo
Day 4: W - Takerufuji, who is this old man with so much power?
Day 6: W - Takarafuji, what beats a smart veteran? A slightly younger smart veteran.
Day 7: W - Nishikigi, patient and wise.
Day 8: L - Kinbozan, really good but quick bout though

### Terunofuji
Day 3: W - Kirishima, a hard fought win

### Tobizaru
Day ?: W - Onosato (?)
Day 3: W - Kotozakura, wily fliying monkey moves out of the way
Day 4: W - Terunofuji, this flying monkey stopped a mountain
Day 5: W - Ura, Flying Monkey wins with flight
Day 6: L - Oho, great escapes but not enough.
Day 7: W - Shodai, great footwork at the edge, like GREAT
Day 8: L - Abi, good fight though

### Ura

Day 1: W - Shodai
Day 2: L - Chiyoshoma, exciting
Day 3: L - Gonoyama, even when Ura loses he's exciting
Day 4: W - Takayasu, HOLY SHIT INSANE MOVES BUDDY!
Day 7: W - Ichiyamamoto, flying man wins again!
Day 8: W - Endo, good arm bar throw

Day 14: W - Wakatakakage - Ura uses power and it works

### Wakamotoharu
Like a fine wine, getting better.

Day 1: W - Atamifuji
Day 6: L - Takanosho was smart and patient.  Wakamotoharu looks well below his best.
Day 8: L - Kirishima - Haru just doesn't look good.

Day 13: L - Ichiyamamoto - Haru is still doing the forearm shiver, deserves these losses

### Wakatakakage
Up to Day 5, having issues at the higher rank, but nothing embarassing.

Day 1: W - YOKOZUNA
Day 4: W - Atamifuji
Day 6: W - Abi, basically a henka.
Day 7: L - Kirishima, just couldn't get his arm back.

Day 13: W - Shodai, fantastic control
Day 13: W - Shodai, fantastic control
