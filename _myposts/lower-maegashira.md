## Shishi - The Ukrainian Giant
{% include wrestler-section.html text="Remember Shishi? Ukrainian guy who has a huge body and a huge heart and not much skill? This bout on Day 3 is a perfect example of his entire tournament:" videos="gIcv7p8BLuE" %}

## Asakoryu - The Compact Powerhouse
{% include wrestler-section.html text="Small (in Sumo) guy who is nothing but muscles. He had a very bad tournament at the start, but came away with a 6-9. He'll probably get demoted to Juryo, but that's not uncommon for your first attempt (see Shishi)." %}

## Takerufuji - The Comeback Kid
{% include wrestler-section.html text="He's back in the top division after winning it on his first try then getting injured. Had a totally respectable 10-5. 3 of his losses were to 3 of the best wrestlers. He's going to rise to the top I feel." videos="j0kx_I9Q9VE" %}

## Chiyoshoma - The Tactical Veteran
{% include wrestler-section.html text="I feel like you might like Chiyoshoma for a few reasons. - He's nearing the end of his career, but fighting hard not to drop out of the ranks. - He looks and acts like a perfect 'bad guy'. - He always has a plan for every opponent he meets, super tactical and often very decisive very fast. He's back in the top division after being hard-stuck to the 2nd division last year. He went 11-4, great record." %}

## Tamawashi - The Veteran Fighter
{% include wrestler-section.html text="Tamawashi had a winning record (8-7, also called 'kachi-koshi'), which means he's going to be wrestling in the top division at 40 years old." %}

## Ura - The Spectacular Performer
{% include wrestler-section.html text="My beloved Ura. He's one of those guys who has horrible tournaments and amazing tournaments, and this was one of the horrible ones. He went 5-10, had some great bouts. This one vs Wakamotoharu shows great technique from both of them." videos="SUP227-qqtM, mnZQ5BYF2wk" %}
