<h1>Update for you!</h1>
I found a sumo channel and blog called "Sumo Stomp" that seems to post....everything. <br />
So if you want to watch anyone that I don't talk about, or any matches, check them out. <br/>
Since it's all in Japanese, the thumbnails help.  It shows the Day number and the Date at the top of the thumbnails, and doesn't have spoilers.

<h3>Onto the wrestlers!</h3>

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Atamifuji - The Young Monster" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4055/" text="Squeaked out an 8-7 from Maegashira #3 after having a 6-day losing streak in the middle of the tournament. He's still having a very hard time getting into the 'sanyaku' ranks, but he's still young and he seems to always be learning. He's a monster man." videos="ONHDqO7IpeI" %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Abi - The Disruptor" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3485/" text="Abi had a great tournament, going 11-4 and being a terror against everyone and causing upsets. Great bounceback from his previous tournament when he went 5-10. <br/>
Abi is 'the disrupter' because he is the kind of wrestler that can beat anyone on his day (he's even won a Yusho in the past).  His long arms are fucking nightmare too." videos="HFr_Ubv_NIw" %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Hiradoumi - The Determined Fighter" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3705/" text="Oof. He went 4-11, including a 7 day losing streak. He fought his ass off every single bout and barely lost so many, but he just kept losing. He was already demoted last tournament to Maegashira #1, this might be a big drop down the ranks for him now." videos="mCJCSknuFr8" %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Daieisho - The Complete Package" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3376/" text="
This tournament I decided he's one of my favorites. <br />
He's got tons of fight in him, he's got just the right mix of build for Sumo, between his bulk and his muscles, and he can kick anyone's ass on his day. <br /> 
Even if he can't always beat the best, he can make them work hard for it." videos="TKWn7lteflc" %}
