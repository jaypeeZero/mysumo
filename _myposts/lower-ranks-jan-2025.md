### Ura (The Acrobat)
Started strong and had some incredible matches. His Day 4 match against Takayasu was particularly spectacular. Showed he can win with both his trademark acrobatics and straight-up power, as demonstrated in his Day 14 win against Wakatakakage. His creative style continues to make him one of the most entertaining wrestlers to watch.

### Wakamotoharu (The Struggling Veteran)
A disappointing tournament for the elder Waka brother. While he started with promise, beating Atamifuji on Day 1, his performance declined notably. His continued reliance on the forearm shiver proved costly, and as noted on Day 13, these losses were well-deserved. Needs to adapt his strategy to return to his previous form.

### Wakatakakage (The Giant Killer)
Started the tournament with an impressive win against a Yokozuna, showing his potential. Had mixed results throughout, including a smart win against Abi on Day 6 (though essentially a henka). Showed excellent control in his Day 13 victory against Shodai. Despite some losses, continues to demonstrate his ability to compete at a high level.

### Chiyoshoma (The Crafty Veteran)
Made an impressive return to the top division, showing what he calls "thinking man's Sumo". Won his first six matches with a combination of defense, throws, and tactical awareness. While he had some setbacks, including a Day 8 loss to Takarafuji, his experience and ring craft were evident throughout. His Day 15 bout against Shonanoumi ended controversially with a post-match incident.

### Tamashoho (The Late Bloomer)
An interesting story - finally reaching the top division after 13 years. Despite his relatively small size for sumo (under 300lbs, 6'2"), he's finding success through technique and experience. His Day 8 match against Midorifuji is particularly noteworthy. Training in a small stable of just four wrestlers with his brother-in-law Tamawashi seems to be paying off.

### Hakuoho (The Comeback Kid)
Back in the top division after falling to unsalaried ranks due to injury. Had mixed results but showed promise, including an impressive first-time meeting with Tobizaru on Day 11. His Day 7 win against Tamashoho demonstrated his tactical awareness with a well-executed henka-dodge.

### Ichiyamamoto (The Rising Force)
Deserves recognition for his performance, particularly his Day 15 win against Wakatakakage, showing both intelligence and execution in his sumo.
