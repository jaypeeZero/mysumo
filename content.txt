Sumo ranks for reference: https://www.sumotalk.com/pyramid.gif
Shishi:https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3990/Remember Shishi? Ukrainian guy who has a huge body and a huge heart and not much skill?
This bout on Day 3 is a perfect example of his entire tournament:
Shishi vs Onokatsu : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIcv7p8BLuE
Asakoryu: (ah-sah-koh-ryu)
Small (in Sumo) guy who is nothing but muscles.https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4101/He had a very bad tournament at the start, but came away with a 6-9.  He'll probably get demoted to Juryo, but that's not uncommon for your first attempt (see Shishi).
Takerufuji (skips leg day guy): (tah-care-ooo-foo-jee)
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4171/
He's back in the top division after winning it on his first try then getting injured.Had a totally respectable 10-5.3 of his losses were to 3 of the best wrestlers.He's going to rise to the top I feel.
Chiyoshoma: (chee-yo-sho-mah)
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3207/
I feel like you might like Chiyoshoma for a few reasons.
- He's nearing the end of his career, but fighting hard not to drop out of the ranks.- He looks and acts like a perfect "bad guy".- He always has a plan for every opponent he meets, super tactical and often very decisive very fast.
He's back in the top division after being hard-stuck to the 2nd division last year.  He went 11-4, great record.
Tamawashi: (tah-mah-wah-she)
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/2629/
He had a winning record (8-7, also called "kachi-koshi"), which means he's going to be wrestling in the top division at 40 years old. 

Atamifuji: (ah-tah-mee-foo-jee)
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4055/
Squeaked out an 8-7 from Maegashira #3 after having a 6-day losing streak in the middle of the tournament.He's still having a very hard time getting into the "sanyaku" ranks, but he's still young and he seems to always be learning.He's a monster man.
Abi: (c'mon dog)
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3485/Abi had a great tournament, going 11-4 and being a terror against everyone and causing upsets.Great bounceback from his previous tournament when he went 5-10.

Ura: 
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3616/
My beloved Ura.  He's one of those guys who has horrible tournaments and amazing tournaments, and this was one of the horrible ones.He went 5-10, had some great bouts.This one vs Wakamotoharu shows great technique from both of them.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUP227-qqtM 
This one vs Hiradoumi was 6 minutes long and had 2 restarts because they kept going out of the ring at the same time.  One of them, Ura showed some incredible skill by flying fully horizontal through the air while pushing his opponent out and keeping an awareness of where the ground was.  It was an absolute spectacle and both wrestlers gave 100% every damned second.

Hiradoumi: (he-ra-dough-ooh-mee)
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3705/
Oof.He went 4-11, including a 7 day losing streak.  He fought his ass off every single bout and barely lost so many, but he just kept losing.He was already demoted last tournament to Maegashira #1, this might be a big drop down the ranks for him now.
Daieisho: (die-ay-sho)
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3376/
This tournament I decided he's one of my favorites.  He's got tons of fight in him, he's got just the right mix of build for Sumo, between his bulk and his muscles, and he can kick anyone's ass on his day.
Wakamotoharu: (waka-moto-haru)
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3371/
A very "statesman-like" performance.  He was calm and assured and in control.  
Got a 10-5, which is very good and could have been better.  2 of his losses were to wrestlers who went 4-11.
Wakatakakage: (waka-taka-ka-gay)https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3761/
He's only in his 3rd tournament back in the top division after going through a busted ACL and getting demoted all the way to the bottom of the Sumo ranks.He went 10-5 from Maegashira #2, which means "He's back baby!".He's back at the top, with his brother, and he's ready to go higher.Here's a great bout from him against Kirishima (former Ozeki like 2 tournaments ago)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQdUSIKfB8o
Onosato: (ono-sato)https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4227/
The great boy wonder.  Fresh off his first tournament win, he's now an Ozeki and ready for his push to Yokozuna!He went 9-6.  womp womp9-6 is like the bare minimum respectable record for an Ozeki.  It's not even an Ozeki-sustaining performance.  You need 33 wins across 3 tournaments.He wasn't bad, in fact he's still a huge scary monster and his tachi-ai (the start) is like an elephant coming for you.But Sumo isn't just about bodies, it's about brains, and he got sloppy and out-thought in too many matches.In fact, none of his losses were even upsets, so the 9-6 might be bad, but it's not the whole story.Here is a fun bout for him.  It's him vs Takerufuji (skips leg day).  
Remember, they were college rivals and both had quick rises through the ranks.  Takerufuji actually won a tournament first, but then got a major injury and this was his return to the top.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0kx_I9Q9VE
Hoshoryu and Kotozakura: (ho-sho-ryu) - (koto-zakura)https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3842/https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3661/
These 2 gave us the true great story of the basho.Both established Ozeki, both probably watching all the attention Onosato has been getting, and hearing the media talking about "when" he becomes Yokozuna, and both probably thinking "Hang on, we're right here and he hasn't proven he's better than us yet."They both were 13-1 going into the last day and were facing each other (not always guaranteed on the last day).  
Absolute spectacle.

Leading up to it, they both had some great performances.  Too many to give you all in fact.
The one that stands out would be Wakatakakage vs Hoshoryu from Day 5.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D-xMEjptmsThat bout epitomizes Hoshoryu's tournament.  In fact that was the start of him winning 4 out of 5 days in a row with a throw. 

Kotozakura's tournament didn't really have a pattern.  Sometimes he'd win looking like a floating boulder with arms constantly moving forward, sometimes he'd win at the very edge with a sneaky shift and dodge as his opponent was just about to win, but he just kept winning.Fun fact I learned about Kotozakura.  His weirdly shaped body has been mentioned by multiple wrestlers as a reason he's so hard to fight against.  He's a doughy lumpy man and it works for him.

Here is the final match between Hoshoryu and Kotozakura: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvnbfTdp0CwNow here is where it gets super special.They are both Ozeki.You must have 33 out of 45 wins across 3 tournaments to remain an Ozeki.  A very hard task.The only higher rank is Yokozuna.  
Sorry if this is reiterating, but to be a Yokozuna, you have to first become an Ozeki and then win 2 tournaments in a row (or equivalent performance).It has to be one of the hardest ranks to earn in sports, and nobody does it who isn't amazing at Sumo.
So because both Ozeki went into the last day with 13-1, no matter which one loses, they still had an "equivalent performance" to a tournament win.
Which means that next tournament, if both achieve "equivalent performances", we could have 2 Yokozunas promoted in the exact same tournament.  

Terunofuji: (tear-ooo-no-foo-jee)https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3321/
You might not even remember him.  That's the current Yokozuna.  He's so broken he has only completed 3 tournaments in the last 2 years.And he won all 3.So basically, his body is falling apart, like bad, but when he shows up, he wins because he's a monster.He didn't show up this tournament.  I'm wondering if you'll ever see him show up.
This was him a few days ago (December 2024) against the 3 Ozeki during practice.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ToLenAJvuM

LOWER DIVISION STORIES
Tsurugisho: 
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3504/I think I told you about him as one of the typical sad stories of Sumo.  
A man whose aged body has already given out on him, desperately trying not to get demoted out of the 2nd division, because those are the only guys who get paid a salary.
Well...he went 10-5 from Juryo #7 which is just about good enough to get him promoted to the top division...maybe.
Aonishiki: 
https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4230/
The other Ukranian after Shishi.  This one is the one who looks nutso good.  Technique for days, and can shove like a bulldozer too apparently.He went 10-5 from Juryo #11, so probably not going to get to the top division just yet, but he'll make it one day barring injury.
Wakaikari:https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4191/19 year old kid, his first tournament in the 2nd division.Sadly went 7-8 so could get demoted, but he's definitely one to watch.And what a name.
Hakuoho:https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4187/Another wonderkid.  This is the one that was trained by Hakuho (greatest Yokozuna of all time).  He's also the one with tree-trunks for legs.  2 tree trunks per leg maybe even. 
10-5 from Juryo #2, that's a definite promotion.
The "wonderkids" are getting out of hand honestly.We've got:Onosato, Takerufuji, Hakuoho, Wakaikari, Aonishiki, and Atamifuji that I can think of.
2 of them have already won a tournament (Onosato, Takerufuji) (and Hakuoho was in the running on the last day of his top division debut).
2 of them already went through "get to the top division, get a horrible injury, get demoted far, get back to the top division" (Takerufuji, Hakuoho).3 of them are in the Top 10 in the last 100 years for how fast they made the top division after starting professional Sumo (Onosato, Hakuoho, Aonishiki).4 of them have bodies seemingly built for being dominant at Sumo. (Wakaikaria is the only one who seems "normal").
It's like Sumo decided to generate a god-tier era right as you started watching man.
