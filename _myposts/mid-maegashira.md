{% include wrestler-section.html name="Atamifuji - The Young Monster" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4055/" text="Squeaked out an 8-7 from Maegashira #3 after having a 6-day losing streak in the middle of the tournament. He's still having a very hard time getting into the 'sanyaku' ranks, but he's still young and he seems to always be learning. He's a monster man." %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Abi - The Disruptor" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3485/" text="Abi had a great tournament, going 11-4 and being a terror against everyone and causing upsets. Great bounceback from his previous tournament when he went 5-10." %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Hiradoumi - The Determined Fighter" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3705/" text="Oof. He went 4-11, including a 7 day losing streak. He fought his ass off every single bout and barely lost so many, but he just kept losing. He was already demoted last tournament to Maegashira #1, this might be a big drop down the ranks for him now." %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Daieisho - The Complete Package" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3376/" text="This tournament I decided he's one of my favorites. He's got tons of fight in him, he's got just the right mix of build for Sumo, between his bulk and his muscles, and he can kick anyone's ass on his day." %}
