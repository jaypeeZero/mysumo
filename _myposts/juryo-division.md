# The Future Stars
The second division is full of both rising stars and veterans fighting to maintain their careers. This tournament showed us several promising young wrestlers who might soon make their mark in the top division.

### Tsurugisho (The Comeback Veteran)

One of the typical sad stories of Sumo - a man whose aged body has already given out on him, desperately trying not to get demoted out of the 2nd division, because those are the only guys who get paid a salary. Well... he went 10-5 from Juryo #7 which is just about good enough to get him promoted to the top division... maybe.

### Aonishiki (The Ukrainian Technician)

The other Ukrainian after Shishi. This one is the one who looks nutso good. Technique for days, and can shove like a bulldozer too apparently. He went 10-5 from Juryo #11, so probably not going to get to the top division just yet, but he'll make it one day barring injury.

### Wakaikari (The Young Promise)

19 year old kid, his first tournament in the 2nd division. Sadly went 7-8 so could get demoted, but he's definitely one to watch. And what a name.

### Hakuoho (The Heir Apparent)

Another wonderkid. This is the one that was trained by Hakuho (greatest Yokozuna of all time). He's also the one with tree-trunks for legs. 2 tree trunks per leg maybe even. 10-5 from Juryo #2, that's a definite promotion.

# The New Generation

The "wonderkids" are getting out of hand honestly. We've got:  

  - Onosato  
  - Takerufuji  
  - Hakuoho  
  - Wakaikari  
  - Aonishiki  
  - Atamifuji  

Two of them have already won a tournament:  

  - Onosato  
  - Takerufuji  
(and Hakuoho was in the running on the last day of his top division debut).  

Two of them already went through "get to the top division, get a horrible injury, get demoted far, get back to the top division":  
  - Takerufuji  
  - Hakuoho  

Three of them are in the Top 10 in the last 100 years for how fast they made the top division after starting professional Sumo:  
  - Onosato  
  - Hakuoho  
  - Aonishiki  

Four of them have bodies seemingly built for being dominant at Sumo:  
(Wakaikari is the only one who seems "normal").

# It's like Sumo decided to generate a god-tier era right as you started watching!
