# The Brothers!

## Wakamotoharu (The Statesman)

A very "statesman-like" performance. He was calm and assured and in control.
Got a 10-5, which is very good and could have been better. 2 of his losses were to wrestlers who went 4-11.

## Wakatakakage (The Comeback Kid)

He's only in his 3rd tournament back in the top division after going through a busted ACL and getting demoted all the way to the bottom of the Sumo ranks.
He went 10-5 from Maegashira #2, which means "He's back baby!".
He's back at the top, with his brother, and he's ready to go higher.

Here's a great bout from him against Kirishima (former Ozeki like 2 tournaments ago):
