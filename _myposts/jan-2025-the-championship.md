# The story of the tournament.

If you remember the story of LAST tournament (November 2024), it was all about the Ozeki.
[Kotozakura](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3661/), [Hoshoryu](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3842/), and [Onosato](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4227/).

### Reminders:

- Ozeki - 2nd highest rank in Sumo, must maintain 33 wins across 3 tournaments to hold rank. VERY hard.
- Yokozuna - Highest rank in Sumo, can only be earned by someone winning 2 tournaments _in a row_ (or equivalent performance) _FROM_ the Ozeki rank. Only 74 men in history have ever achieved it.

Last tournament, new Ozeki Onosato, the new golden boy, was the talk of all the media.
His meteoric rise makes him look like one of the best talents to ever wrestle in Sumo.
The other 2 Ozeki, Hoshoryu and Kotozakura, seemed to take that media attention personally, and dominated the November tournament.

It came down to _a playoff on the final day between the 2 Ozeki_ for the title.
In the end, Kotozakura won his first tournament, and Hoshoryu came 2nd, only in the playoff.
Onosato had a disappointing 9-6 record.

# YOKOZUUUUUUUNA!

Since both of those Ozeki had effectively "won" a tournament, they were _both_ up for potential promotion to Yokozuna if they could acheive a tournament win this time.

## Kotozakura

5-10. That's his record.

The man who just won the last tournament, and was on a run for Yokozuna, the point of his whole life's work, and he went 5-10.

If that doesn't tell you everything you know about him, then I will say...it makes sense.  
He's very talented, VERY big and VERY VERY hard to move. And when the pressure hits, he crumbles frequently.
If I can speculate, I honestly think it's because of the pressure of family.  
His grandfather was a Yokozuna, and his dad is his coach. He fits the stereotype of a talented but driven-by-his-dad sports star.
I'll show some of his matches _when I talk about other wrestlers, because they beat him probably_.

## Onosato

10-5.

A better tournament, but still just about the bare minimum needed from an Ozeki. He didn't challenge for the tournament at any point, he had a few good matches, but it took him until Day 6 to look like he _earned_ a win.

His biggest problem is his lack of control of _himself_. He still has an incredible future ahead of him.

# A SURPRISE!

I cannot tell you about the 3rd Ozeki, Hoshoryu, until I first tell you about the tournaments of [Kinbozan](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4112/), and [Oho](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3844/).

## Oho

I don't remember if I told you about [Oho](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3844/).

He is one of "last years" crop of super promising youngsters. He will turn 25 in February.  
He made the top division all the way back in 2022, and stayed there. His performances were nothing major, but it was clear he had a strong future ahead of him.

Speaking of "family pressure", Oho's grandfather is [Taiho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taih%C5%8D_K%C5%8Dki), the 48th Yokozuna, and one you will hear his name MANY times if you pay attention to records.

Oho has learned and grown slowly, and has kept himself around the top Maegashira ranks (top division, just below the "named" ranks at the very top) until this tournament when he decided to challenge for the title from Maegashira #3.

(if you want to watch his matches later, this link has his Japanese name in the search, pay attention to the video _dates_: https://www.youtube.com/@sumo-video/search?query=%E7%8E%8B%E9%B5%AC)

## Kinbozan

The only time I mentioned [Kinbozan](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4112/) to you, was back when we FIRST started talking about Sumo. I said he was one of 2 guys who the universe gave a "perfect Sumo build to", but that he seemed unable to use that perfect build to be good at Sumo.

Kinbozan has spent the last few tournaments bouncing between the 2nd division, and the top division. He has bulk and muscle, but just doesn't put it together well to win.

Off the back of winning the 2nd division (Juryo), he came into this tournament at Maegashira #14. Just below the middle of the pack.

Then he won 9 days in a row. Including the 2 "ranked up" fights. Once a wrestler starts doing well within a tournament, outperforming their rank, the matches start getting shaken up. You can't have someone win the tournament from tthe bottom ranks by only fighting against other bottom ranks. So they start having that over-performing wrestler go up against harder opponents to test them.

Kinbozan went 12-2 up to the final day, beating up-and-comer [Takerufuji](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4171/) (super muscle boy), Onosato (yes, the Ozeki), Kotozakura (yes, the Ozeki), and[Kirishima](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3622/) (_former_ Ozeki 3 tournaments ago).

(if you want to watch HIS matches _later_: https://www.youtube.com/@sumo-video/search?query=%E9%87%91%E5%B3%B0%E5%B1%B1 , and you might enjoy them as it's fun to watch a "bad" wrestler suddenly find consistency)

# FINAL DAY!

Which brings us to the final day.

Kinbozan was _in the lead_ in the final day at 12-2, with Oho and Hoshoryu 1 loss behind him at 11-3.

His opponent was Oho.

Keep in mind that Kinbozan is _massively overperforming_ this tournament.
If he wins this match _he wins the whole tournament AND stops Hoshoryu from becoming a Yokozuna_.

Here is the match on the final day vs Oho.

After you watch that, now watch the last 10 minutes of the official highlights of the final day, starting with Hoshryu's match _against Kotozakura_.

After all this, _tell me you have made it this far so I can talk to you about it!_
