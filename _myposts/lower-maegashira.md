{% include wrestler-section.html name="Shishi - The Ukrainian Giant" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3990/" text="Remember Shishi? Ukrainian guy who has a huge body and a huge heart and not much skill? This bout on Day 3 is a perfect example of his entire tournament:" videos="gIcv7p8BLuE" %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Asakoryu - The Compact Powerhouse" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4101/" text="Small (in Sumo) guy who is nothing but muscles. He had a very bad tournament at the start, but came away with a 6-9. He'll probably get demoted to Juryo, but that's not uncommon for your first attempt (see Shishi)." %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Takerufuji - The Comeback Kid" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4171/" text="He's back in the top division after winning it on his first try then getting injured. Had a totally respectable 10-5. 3 of his losses were to 3 of the best wrestlers. He's going to rise to the top I feel." videos="j0kx_I9Q9VE" %}

I feel like you might like Chiyoshoma for a few reasons. 
  - He's nearing the end of his career, but fighting hard not to drop out of the ranks. 
  - He looks and acts like a perfect 'bad guy'. 
  - He always has a plan for every opponent he meets, super tactical and often very decisive very fast. 
  
He's back in the top division after being hard-stuck to the 2nd division last year. He went 11-4, great record." %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Tamawashi - The Timeless Veteran" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/2629/" text="Tamawashi had a winning record (8-7, also called 'kachi-koshi'), which means he's going to be wrestling in the top division at 40 years old." %}

{% include wrestler-section.html name="Ura - The Spectacular" profile_url="https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3616/" text="My beloved Ura. He's one of those guys who has horrible tournaments and amazing tournaments, and this was one of the horrible ones. He went 5-10, had some great bouts. This one vs Wakamotoharu shows great technique from both of them. And this one vs Hiradoumi was 6 minutes long and had 2 restarts because they kept going out of the ring at the same time.  One of them, Ura showed some incredible skill by flying fully horizontal through the air while pushing his opponent out and keeping an awareness of where the ground was.  It was an absolute spectacle and both wrestlers gave 100% every damned second." videos="SUP227-qqtM,mnZQ5BYF2wk" %}
