Let's start our January 2024 tournament review with some of the lower-ranked wrestlers who made interesting stories this basho. For reference on sumo ranks, check out [this rank pyramid](https://www.sumotalk.com/pyramid.gif).

## Shishi - The Ukrainian Giant

Remember Shishi? He's the Ukrainian rikishi with a huge body and an equally huge heart, though still developing his skills. [His profile](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3990/) shows his impressive physical presence, but this tournament demonstrated both his potential and current limitations.

His bout on Day 3 against Onokatsu perfectly encapsulates his entire tournament performance:

## Asakoryu - The Compact Powerhouse

[Asakoryu](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4101/) (pronounced ah-sah-koh-ryu) is relatively small by sumo standards, but makes up for it with pure muscle. While his tournament started poorly, he managed to finish with a 6-9 record. Though this will likely result in demotion to Juryo, that's not uncommon for a first attempt in the top division - just ask Shishi!

## Takerufuji - The Comeback Kid

[Takerufuji](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/4171/) (pronounced tah-care-ooo-foo-jee) made a strong return to the top division after his previous injury setback. Despite being known as the rikishi who "skips leg day," he posted a very respectable 10-5 record. Notably, three of his losses came against some of the division's top performers, suggesting he's ready to climb higher in the ranks.

## Chiyoshoma - The Tactical Veteran

[Chiyoshoma](https://www.sumo.or.jp/EnSumoDataRikishi/profile/3207/) (pronounced chee-yo-sho-mah) is a fascinating wrestler to watch. He's fighting hard to maintain his position in the top division as his career enters its later stages. What makes him particularly interesting is his approach to sumo:

- He has a reputation as a perfect "heel" character
- His tactical approach means he always has a specific game plan for each opponent
- His matches often end decisively and quickly

After struggling in the second division last year, he's made a strong return to Makuuchi with an impressive 11-4 record.

This group of wrestlers shows the diversity of stories and styles in sumo's top division, from newcomers still finding their footing to veterans using every trick in their arsenal to stay competitive.
